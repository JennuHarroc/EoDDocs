Sacred Trees Antiquity  

Note: Watch your individual points during the event.  If you reach your max points, please stop killing trees for others.  Join rallies though.  

Phase 1:  
Send full cavalry march to ents.  As of lvl5 event, this is enough to kill them.  

Phase 2:  
Highest Stat player #1 + 1 fighter SH each start a 2 minute rally on north.    
Highest Stat player #2 + 1 fighter SH each start a 2 minute rally on east.  
Work clockwise.  

Phase 3:  
Double rally center.  
Once center is ~1/4 health, check individual points and event timer. Time permitting, have players kill ents to finish individual points.  
Finish doubles on center until event is complete.
